A 2fa protected password manager, it is simply a showcase project not meant for public use.

It is meant only as a project for personal use for myself, while I believe it to be cryptographically sound I am sure that there would be some security issue that someone more knowledgable in cryptography could find and I do not plan on releasing patches for this so I advise that you use a password manager that will patch any issues they may have.
